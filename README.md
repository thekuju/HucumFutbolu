Statistics
-------------

You could say there are three leagues in the app, a player ranking league, a double(or more) team league and a single league.

* The player ranking league is a race between individual players. Players get or loose ranking points for every match they play(single, double or more).

* The double league is a classic soccer league table. The team earns 3 points for a win and 1 point for a draw.' 

* The single league works the same way as the double league, but this league only summerizes individual players.


Player ranking calculation and the 10% rule
-------------

The rules are simple but a little bit different. The tournament is a race between individual players but you get individual ranking points on all kinds of matches(single, doubles or more).  All players starts out with 1000 ranking points and when you win a match you earn 10% of your opponents ranking points. If you team up with another player, you can only loose as much as 10% of the lowest ranked player in your team.
